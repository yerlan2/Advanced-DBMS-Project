# **influence**

Influence is a community publishing platform, willfully blurring the lines between blogging and social networking. This is a web application.
It is home to a wide array of creative individuals looking to share common interests, meet new friends, and express themselves.
Our product will empower people to share ideas, offer support and make a difference.
We want to help them learn, work, communicate and have fun.

Influence encourages communal interaction and personal expression by offering a user-friendly interface and a deeply customizable blog system.
The service's individuality stems from the way highly dedicated users utilize our simple tools, along with the instinct for individual expression, to create new venues for online socializing.

With topics like politics, entertainment, fashion, literature and design, some key similarities emerge: the overall culture is distinctly open source-not only from a product perspective-but from a cultural one. The spirit of volunteerism pervades Influence, crossing all boundaries and propagated via insanely passionate individuals. At Influence creativity, diversity and tolerance are the mainstream.

### Our Principles:

#### Self-Expression
Our tools allow our user community to communicate with each other in immediate and creative ways. We believe in letting our users create their own content, to choose how they express themselves, their thoughts, and their feelings.

#### Diversity
We welcome and respect different opinions, different cultures, and different perspectives, and are committed to helping our users share their diversity with others. LiveJournal brings people of various backgrounds together, and strongly supports freedom of expression.

#### Creativity
We encourage our user community to use Influence to share the process of creating their content with friends. We believe that everyone has something to offer, whatever form it may take, and want to make it easy for our users to share that with the world.

#### Community
Influence thrives because of loyal users and active community volunteers. We're committed to collaborating with the community in order to improve the service for everyone, so we work to incorporate member feedback into our product and technical decisions. The Influence community enjoys an unprecedented amount of inspiration and input into product and policy decisions.

#### Privacy
We make sure to safeguard our users' private blog entries but also provide tools that allow them to choose with whom to share the content they want to share, be it with just a small group of friends, or with a larger user-created community. We respect the decisions our users make, and let them decide how to protect the content they create. We continue to maintain the service that the Influence community trusts.

## Technologies

### **User interface**

We are going to build a full web application.

Advantages:
Reaching a Wider Audience <br>
The first and perhaps most obvious advantage of a website is the potential for reaching a wider audience. The internet is used by literally millions of people, all of them are looking for something and some of them might be looking for you!

Anyone, Anywhere & Anytime <br>
An advantage of having a website is your valuable information and details about your products and services can be accessed by anyone, no matter where they are on the planet or what time of day it is.

Easy Access To Information <br>
With a website, users can easily access information about your business. They can see what products or services you sell, your prices, your location and much more. Whatever you decide to tell them, they can find it with a few clicks of a mouse.

### Programming language: **Python**

### **♕ Django**

Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source. 

**Why Django?**

**Ridiculously fast.**

Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

**Fully loaded.**

Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.

**Reassuringly secure.**

Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

**Exceedingly scalable.**

Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.

**Incredibly versatile.**

Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.

### Database: SQL

### **♔ SQLite**

**What Is SQLite?**

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day.

The SQLite file format is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compatible. SQLite database files are commonly used as containers to transfer rich content between systems and as a long-term archival format for data. There are over 1 trillion SQLite databases in active use.

SQLite source code is in the public-domain and is free to everyone to use for any purpose.

SQLite emphasizes economy, efficiency, reliability, independence, and simplicity.

Situations Where SQLite Works Well:

- Server-side database

- Websites

- File archive and/or data container

- Cache

- Data analysis

- Embedded devices and the IOT
